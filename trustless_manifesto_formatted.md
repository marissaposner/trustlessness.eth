## I. Why trustlessness matters

Every system begins with good intentions.  
A hosted node here, a whitelisted relayer there.  
Each is harmless on its own — and together they become habit.

Gateways become platforms.  
Platforms become landlords.  
Landlords decide who may enter and what they may do.

The only defense is *trustless design*: systems whose correctness and fairness depend only on math and consensus, never on the goodwill of intermediaries.

Trustlessness is not a feature to add after the fact.  
It is **the** thing itself.  
Without it, everything else — efficiency, UX, scalability — is decoration on a fragile core.

Trustlessness is how credible neutrality is achieved.  
Without it, the system becomes one that depends on intermediaries.

## II. Why we build on Ethereum

We build on Ethereum because we choose verification over blind trust.  
We write code so that power cannot hide behind policy.  
We design protocols so that freedom does not depend on permission.

Ethereum was not created to make finance efficient or apps convenient.  
It was created to set people free — to empower anyone, anywhere to coordinate without permission and without trusting anyone they cannot hold accountable.

Ethereum is the path to trustlessness.  
That promise must not be lost as we scale.

## III. What trustlessness means

A system is trustless when any honest participant can join, verify, and act **without permission and without fear**.

This requires:

1. **Self-sovereignty** — each user authorizes their own actions; no one acts on their behalf.  
2. **Verifiability** — anyone can confirm what happened from public data.  
3. **Censorship resistance** — any valid action can be included, within a reasonable timeframe and without undue cost.  
4. **Walkaway test** — if one operator disappears or misbehaves, another can step in without approval.  
5. **Accessibility** — participation must be within reach of ordinary users, not only experts with servers and capital.  
6. **Transparency of incentives** — participants are governed by protocol rules, not private contracts or opaque APIs.

Remove any of these, and the system drifts from protocol to platform — from neutral ground to private property.

## IV. What trustlessness demands

Trustlessness is expensive.  
It requires redundancy, openness, and complexity.  
It requires mempools that anyone can use, even if that invites spam.  
It requires clients that anyone can run, even if few will.  
It requires governance that moves slowly, because no one can override consensus.

Every shortcut that assumes trust eventually costs freedom.  
Trustlessness depends on free open source software — not only code that can be read, but code that can be freely run, verified, and improved.

A trustless design must therefore obey three laws:

1. **No critical secrets.**  
   No step of a protocol should depend on private information held by a single actor — except the user themselves.
2. **No indispensable intermediaries.**  
   Anyone who forwards, executes, or attests must be replaceable by any other participant following the same rules.  
   “Anyone can run one” is not enough — participation must be *practically* open, not reserved for those with servers, funding, and DevOps skills.  
   A system that depends on intermediaries most users cannot realistically replace is not trustless; it merely concentrates trust in the hands of a smaller class of operators.
3. **No unverifiable outcomes.**  
   Every effect on state must be reproducible and checkable from public data.

These laws are harsh. They limit what we can build easily.  
But they are the only guarantee that what we build belongs to **everyone**.

## V. The drift toward dependence on trust

The drift is not theoretical. It is already here.  
Hosted RPCs are the default.  
If AWS, GCP, and Cloudflare went dark, most apps would too.  
Sequencing is centralized by design in many rollups.  
Upgrade keys still exist. “Training wheels” are used as an excuse to delay decentralization.  
“Self-custody” is delegated to CEXes.  
Cross-chain interoperability has begun to mirror the very centralization it was meant to overcome — solvers and relayers act as gatekeepers of execution, deciding which transactions succeed and which fail.

Trust does not return all at once.  
It returns through defaults slowly.  
Each choice feels harmless, temporary — not like centralization.

No capture, no coup — just comfort.  
Help becomes habit; habit becomes dependence.  
Soon participation depends on infrastructure that only a few can run, and verification becomes the privilege of specialists.

This is how decentralization erodes — not in theory, but in production.  
Not tomorrow, but **today**.

Decentralization erodes not through capture, but through convenience.  
It drifts — automatically, continually — toward dependence on trust.

---

## VI. The limits of delegation

Delegation may exist. Dependence must not.  
Users may choose convenience — a hosted node, a friendly UI, a service that helps them — the protocol must never require it.

If inclusion requires an intermediary, it is not trustless.  
If that intermediary must be trusted, it is not neutral.  
If users can “theoretically” run their own intermediary but in practice never will, the system has replaced permissionless access with *technical gatekeeping*.

A permissionless protocol must not only be *open in code*, but *open in cost, accessibility, and comprehension.*

We have seen this pattern before.  
Email was once fully open — anyone could run their own mailserver.  
In theory, you still can.  
But in practice, spam filters, blocklists, and reputation systems make it nearly impossible for ordinary users.  
Email became effectively centralized — not because the protocol was closed, but because **practical trustlessness was lost**.

We must not let Ethereum’s access layer follow the same path.

---

## VII. The duty of builders

We who design protocols are stewards, not gatekeepers.  
Our duty is not to build what is easiest, but what remains open and self-sovereign.

When complexity tempts us to centralize, we must remember: every line of convenience code can become a choke point.  
When critics ask why our designs are complicated, we should ask them what — or **whom** — they are trusting instead.  
If simplicity comes from trust, it is not simplicity. It is surrender.

Trustlessness costs computation, latency, and mental effort.  
It buys resilience, longevity, neutrality, and freedom.

Trustlessness also requires viable incentives.  
Systems must reward those who sustain them without turning them into gatekeepers.  
A protocol that relies on unpaid altruism will decay.  
A protocol that rewards control will centralize.  
The only stable equilibrium is one where neutrality is profitable.

---

## VIII. The way forward

Ethereum has scaled — now it must stay honest.

As we build new layers, new accounts, and new ways to interact, we must preserve the properties that made Ethereum matter:

- Users initiate their own actions.  
- Anyone can verify and participate.  
- No one can be silently excluded.  
- Logic lives in code, not in contracts of trust.  
- Inclusion depends on incentives, not on reputation or permission.

Trustlessness is not perfection.  
It is a system that fails publicly, transparently, and recoverably — rather than privately and silently.

---

## IX. The pledge

We choose to build trustless systems even when it is harder.  
We pay the cost of openness over the convenience of control.  
We do not outsource neutrality to anyone who can be bribed, coerced, or shut down.  
We measure success not by transactions per second, but by **trust reduced per transaction**.

We refuse to build on infrastructure we cannot replace.  
We refuse to call a system “permissionless” when only the privileged can participate.  
We refuse to trade autonomy for polish, or freedom for frictionless UX.  
Trustlessness is not preserved by consensus alone — it is preserved by resistance.

If your protocol requires faith in an intermediary, change it.  
If it relies on a private gateway, replace it.  
If it hides critical state or logic offchain, expose it.

In the end, the world does not need more efficient middlemen.  
It needs fewer reasons to trust them.

### Trustlessness is the foundation.
Everything else is construction on top of it.

The designs will change. The principles will not.
